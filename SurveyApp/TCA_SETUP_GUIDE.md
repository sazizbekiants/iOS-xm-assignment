# TCA Setup Guide

## Current Status
The project has been set up with a **simplified version** that works without TCA dependency. This allows you to build and run the app immediately while you add the TCA dependency.

## Option 1: Quick Start (Simplified Version)

The app is currently configured to run **without TCA**. You can build and run it immediately:

1. Open `SurveyApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Press **Cmd + R** to build and run
3. The app will work with all features except the advanced TCA architecture

## Option 2: Add TCA Dependency (Recommended)

### Step 1: Add TCA Package
1. In Xcode, go to **File** → **Add Package Dependencies...**
2. In the search field, enter: `https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture`
3. Click **Add Package**
4. Select the latest version (1.0.0 or higher)
5. Make sure **SurveyApp** target is selected
6. Click **Add Package**

### Step 2: Switch to Full TCA Version
After adding the TCA dependency, you can switch to the full TCA implementation:

1. **Replace the main app file**:
   ```swift
   // In SurveyAppApp.swift, replace the current content with:
   import SwiftUI
   import ComposableArchitecture
   
   @main
   struct SurveyAppApp: App {
       var body: some Scene {
           WindowGroup {
               MainContentView(
                   store: Store(
                       initialState: AppState(),
                       reducer: appReducer,
                       environment: AppEnvironment()
                   )
               )
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Delete the simplified files**:
   - `SurveyStore_NoTCA.swift`
   - `InitialScreenView_NoTCA.swift`
   - `SurveyScreenView_NoTCA.swift`

3. **Use the original TCA files**:
   - `SurveyStore.swift` (with TCA imports)
   - `InitialScreenView.swift` (with TCA imports)
   - `SurveyScreenView.swift` (with TCA imports)
   - `MainContentView.swift`

## Features Comparison

| Feature | Simplified Version | Full TCA Version |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| ✅ All UI Features | Yes | Yes |
| ✅ API Integration | Yes | Yes |
| ✅ State Management | Basic | Advanced |
| ✅ Testing | Limited | Comprehensive |
| ✅ Predictable State | No | Yes |
| ✅ Unidirectional Flow | No | Yes |
| ✅ TestStore | No | Yes |

## Testing

### Simplified Version
- Basic functionality works
- Manual testing required
- No unit tests for state management

### Full TCA Version
- Comprehensive unit tests
- TestStore for state testing
- UI tests included
- Mock API service

## Troubleshooting

### If TCA import fails:
1. Make sure the package is added to the correct target
2. Clean build folder (Cmd + Shift + K)
3. Restart Xcode
4. Check that the package appears in Project → Package Dependencies

### If build errors occur:
1. Verify all files are in the correct target
2. Check that no duplicate files exist
3. Ensure proper imports in all files

## Recommendation

**Start with the simplified version** to verify the app works, then **add TCA** for the full architecture benefits:

1. ✅ Test the simplified version first
2. ✅ Add TCA dependency
3. ✅ Switch to full TCA version
4. ✅ Run comprehensive tests

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Build and run the simplified version
2. **When ready**: Add TCA dependency
3. **After TCA**: Switch to full version
4. **Final**: Run all tests and verify functionality

The simplified version provides all the core functionality while the full TCA version adds advanced architecture benefits for maintainability and testing.
